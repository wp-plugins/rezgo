**Rezgo** is a cloud based software as a service booking system that gives businesses the ability to manage their tour or activity inventory, manage reservations, and process credit card payments. This plugin is a full featured front-end booking engine that connects your WordPress site to your Rezgo account.

Every Rezgo WordPress page is search optimized and index ready, which means your site gets all the benefit of your Rezgo content.

You get all the features of the regular Rezgo hosted booking engine plus the flexibility to completely control the look and feel of your customer booking experience.
